# Tornado-Frequency-of-Counties-in-Texas
#
1) Description
#
On October 20, 2019 around 10 tornadoes hit Dallas, Texas.  It left numerous individuals with homes. 
There were no notice signs until the tornadoes started to cause a lot of harm.  Many began to say 
Dallas is not a decent place to live because it is in Tornado Alley which is where a high frequency of 
storms occurs. Because the storms occurred within a 2-mile radius of my home, it clearly is the motivation
of this dataset. The quest to search for the best dataset began for the frequency of tornadoes within the
Dallas, Texas area. There was not a lot of information in the first dataset I found.  However, I found 
another that gave more information and listed the whole state of Texas.  From those datasets, I can provide
the frequency of tornadoes that occur in Dallas, Texas.
